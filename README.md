#Mod11-Lesson-1-Assignment-1

Description: This project is a simple React app showcasing modular components for a basic website. It includes a HEADER for the site title or navigation, an ABOUT section to provide information, and a CONTACT section for user communication. Each component is independently created and imported into the main APP component, ensuring reusability and a clean structure. The app demonstrates foundational React concepts like component-based architecture, JSX, and props (if used).
